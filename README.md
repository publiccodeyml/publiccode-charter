# Welcome to the home of the PublicCode.yml Open Project.

The PublicCode.yml project works to help index and educate the world about the benefits of using the OpenDocument Format OASIS Standard (also published as ISO/IEC 26300).

PublicCode.yml is a YML-based file format for describing software created by or for public administrations, such as office suites, word processors, text/document editors, spreadsheets, and records-keeping software.

The PublicCode.yml project develops and fosters the format, 

PublicCode.yml is _(in the process of becoming)_ an [OASIS Open Project](https://oasis-open-projects.org/). 

ODF is an XML-based file format for personal productivity applications such as office suites, word processors, text/document editors, spreadsheets, and presentation software. Use of ODF guarantees access to your data forever, ensuring that data can be transferred between different computers and operating systems, without having to worry about vendor lock-in or license fees.

The ODF Advocacy project develops non-commercial, informational materials for a sustained communication campaign about the technical advantages and cost-savings of using standard-based document interoperability over proprietary formats.
