# Welcome to the home of the PublicCode.yml Open Project.

The PublicCode.yml project works to help index and educate the world about the benefits of choosing and re-using open source software in public agencies.

PublicCode.yml is a YML-based file format for describing software created by or for public administrations, such as office suites, word processors, text/document editors, spreadsheets, and records-keeping software.

The PublicCode.yml project develops and fosters the format, educates and studies the economic consequences of an open licensing policy at the government. The PublicCode.yml project develops non-commercial, informational materials for a sustained communication campaign about the technical advantages and cost-savings of using standard-based document interoperability over proprietary formats.

PublicCode.yml is _(in the process of becoming)_ an [OASIS Open Project](https://oasis-open-projects.org/).
