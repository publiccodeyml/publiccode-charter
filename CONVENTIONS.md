# Conventions

## Definitions
* Community

* Public money

* Government

* Working group


## Wording
### Allowed
* publiccode.yml
When talking about the file format, it has to be done in such a way. All
lower-case with the extension attached

* {P,p}ublic code
When talking about public code in general, meaning code that is
developed/commissioned using public money and covered by a free and open source
license. 

* open source
When referring to the nature of the code (and its license). Prefer the all
lower-case wording with no ''-''.

* OSS
When indicating open source software in an abbreviated fashion. Use the full
upper-case wording.


### Avoid
* Standard
This should be avoided since we are starting a standardization process which is
not over yet. Furthermore, it is not a de-facto standard yet so using the
''standard'' word may be misleading.
